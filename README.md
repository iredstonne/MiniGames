RetroGames is a **framework** on which developers can create their own **games** with retro feeling in mind.
We use our own OpenGL engine to make all of this possible fast and efficient.                                                         
This framework is built in Java using LWJGL

### Built-in games

By default, we provide some games for you to play, including...

- Tic Tac Toe
